# RPackage
Materials for writing an R Package

These are the materials associated with a one-hour workshop on writing an R Package. 

A PDF of the presentation can be [found here](https://github.com/jalapic/RPackage/blob/master/Writing%20an%20R%20Package.pdf)

There are many resources that the tutorial builds upon that are referenced in the presentation.


Briefly:

We created a package called "domR".  It has 3 functions (`dci`, `get_di_matrix`, `ttri`) and 2 datasets (`caribou`, `bonobos`). 

The tutorial takes you through:

  - setting up and naming a R package
  - adding .R function files
  - adding documentation to functions
  - adding data files
  - adding raw data files
  - adding documentation to data files
  - adding a vignette
  - building the package
  - running CRAN checks on the package
  - how to install the package locally
  - how to publish to GitHub or CRAN
  
The final package can be found in the `domR` folder.   

The other files include example .R files that we may wanted to put into a package, and files that we could adapt for documentation etc.
